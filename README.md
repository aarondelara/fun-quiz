# Aaron's Quiz

## Description

My motivation for creating this little quiz was to just have some fun with trivial questions regarding JavaScript. As a student learning JavaScript, it's good to know some simple facts about JavaScript so I'll always have this test to test my knowledge. The real purpose of creating this quiz was to get used to coding in JS and to sharpen up my skills. I did have a hard time creating this quiz but it ended up feeling good after testing it and seeing it run successfully.
